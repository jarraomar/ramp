        Hello,

        We're glad you're here!

        Ramp has been fortunate to experience exponential growth over the past
        few years and with it our application volume has surged.

        In this situation, many startups opt to use off-the-shelf timed leetcode
        style SaaS tools to thin application volume.

        We thought puzzles in the spirit of a CTF[1] would be more fun and a
        better expression of our values. As we expect you to spend a little bit
        of time on this gating challenge, we thought it was appropriate that we
        put time and effort into crafting it ourselves.

        We're aware answers here might eventually be leaked and we'll probably
        have to refresh this every couple months or so, but please keep in mind
        it'll be very easy to tell once that happens and will only result in
        slowing down our ability to process applications - so please keep the
        flags to yourself.

        All flags are seven letter dictionary words.

        All flag gates are independent of each other - i.e. you don't need to
        find one flag to unlock the next one.

        Please submit at least two flags, but feel free to submit as many as you
        can find.

        Enjoy!
